#NC NEWS
NC News aka Northcoders News is a news website created during my time at Northcoders BootCamp.

Features include: 
Logging in with a pre-determined user on the login page;
Displaying a welcome message on the tab bar when you log in as a user;
Being able to post new comments on articles with your avatar picture showing;
Liking articles;
Posting new articles;
Viewing your profile with all the articles you posted;
Deleting articles;
Viewing all articles in the news database using different queries such as topic, author, posting date, etc.

The news website is not mobile friendly, due to limited time on the bootcamp where I prioritized the functionality of the features I implemented. However, I have another project that uses React Native for mobiles. If you are curious, view Habigotchi [here](https://github.com/dublino8576/habigotchi-front-end)!
